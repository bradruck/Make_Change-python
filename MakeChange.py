#  Program that recursively finds all solutions for making change from
#  a user entered amount in US cents.  The user is asked if only the unique
#  solutions are to be printed (in ascending order - based on total coins
#  required to make the change). Otherwise, all recursive solutions are
#  printed in ascending order. Coins available to make change are a
#  penny(1), nickel(5), dime(10) and quarter(25).

# Global Variable
total_ways = 0

        return 10
